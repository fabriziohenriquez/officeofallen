        <h1>Know Your Rights</h1>
        <p>
          When you are accused of a crime for the first time, your world changes. A police officer approaches you and the
          process begins. Your rights are read, your statement taken, and, likely, handcuffs are placed on
          you for the trip “downtown”. From first contact, the police are making a case against you:
          asking/interrogating you, having you repeat your story (sometimes 5 times). So, don't talk to the police because if you begin answering questions, you have waived your
          right against self-incrimination - don’t do that. The words you use in an attempt to get you
          exonerated usually end up convicting you.
          <br>
          The good news is that you have a lot of constitutional and procedural rights that can protect you. But only if you know
          about them and ask for them. Quickly answering questions without a lawyer present
          can dig you a hole that it too deep to get out of without a conviction. Remember, the strongest
          evidence against you is your admission that you did something.
          <br>
          The differences between Criminal Law and Civil Law are the punishments and burdens of proof.
          In a civil case, the burden is a preponderance of the evidence standard. In a criminal case, the burden is much higher, it is beyond a reasonable
          doubt. The reason the standard is higher in a criminal law case is that more is in jeopardy. A
          civil case can only take money. A criminal case can take your liberty, freedom, and good name.
          <br>
          Don't go through this alone, take an experienced advocate with you. Call Allen Chandler - he's available 24/7.

        <h1>Felonies</h1>
        <p>
          In Texas, police conduct an investigation when someone calls 911 or they see you committing a crime. After they conduct an investigation, they put together a “packet” that is
          reviewed for errors and issues by the police. When they are finished, they send that packet to the Prosecutors
          Office. Usually located with the County District Attorney (DA). The DA assigns it for review
          by a prosecutor (an Assistant District Attorney or ADA) for “probable cause” that a crime
          occurred. If the the ADA and the evidence looks “serious” (usually violent, high amount of
          money, dance to the public at large) the DA will send the “packet” to the Grand Jury. The Grand
          Jury of typically 12 people will vote on whether the case is to be “True Billed” or “No Billed.”
          True Billed means an “Indictment” will be created and you will be facing Felony charges. No Billed means the case is dismissed (it goes away). There
          are five (5) types of Felonies in Texas and the punishment ranges from 6 months confinement to
          life or death depending on the severity.

        <h1>Misdemeanors</h1>
        <p>
          In Texas, after the police have conducted an investigation, they put together a “packet” that is
          reviewed for errors and issues. When they are finished, they send that packet to the Prosecutors
          Office. Usually located with the County District Attorney (DA). The DA assigns it for review
          by a prosecutor (an Assistant District Attorney or ADA) for “probable cause” that a crime
          occurred. If the the ADA and the evidence looks like a "minor crime" it will not go to the Grand
          Jury, but directly to a County Court where, typically, a prosecutor with less than 4 years
          experience will look to resolve the case. Misdemeanor cases with a maximum penalty
          of a year in jail and $4,000 fine. There are thee (3) types of Misdemeanor Punishments in Texas.

      <div id="juvenile-crimes" class="topic-menu col-8">
        <h1>Juvenile Crimes</h1>
        <p>
          When you child is facing charges, you need to hire someone who has experience in Juvenile
          Court with Juvenile Cases. Defending a juvenile case is not the same as it would be for an adult. Some differences are:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Your child, regardless of his or her age, will decide whether he or she
              wants to invoke their right to remain silent or speak with an attorney. Simply asking to talk to
              mom or dad will not work, unless mom or dad is an attorney.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no bail. Your child, if arrested, may be placed in a “Juvenile Justice Center” (a
              nice way to say a jail for children under age 17) and has to have a “hearing” to attempt to obtain
              their release. These hearings take place every ten (10) days and require the parents to attend.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          To those who don’t deal with juvenile cases, and that includes a lot of criminal attorneys who only
          practice in “adult court,” the hearings, requirements, and process is extremely confusing.
          Juvenile cases are very “hands on” and time intensive for parents, child, and attorney. Further,
          the child is charged with “juvenile delinquency.” That could mean anything from disturbing the
          peace to attempted murder. The charges are investigated, psychological interviews are done (sometimes/ and usually without
          parent permission), intensive background checks are done on the parents, and a large probation
          department is making decisions on what type of “rehabilitation” your child requires.
        </p>
          <p>
            This can include going back to his or her parents or being sent to “Youth Village,” “MEDLOCK”, or TJJD. In the event
            the crime is more serious or the child will reach eighteen (18) before rehabilitation can be
            completed, the child’s case can be taken to a Grand Jury and the child tried as an adult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talk to your children. If your child is accused of a crime or juvenile delinquency, teach him or
            her to say they want to speak to an attorney. And have an attorney available. We have
            extensive experience in criminal law and handling juvenile cases. We know what the difference
            is between treatment and punishment and investigates cases extremely thoroughly. Lastly, we
            will keep you and your child informed through the process.

      <div id="DWI" class="topic-menu col-8">
        <h1>DWI</h1>
        <p>
          When you have been drinking or have taken certain medication(s), and attempt to drive,
          you risk being arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). In Texas, the criminal code for
          Driving While Intoxicated is Texas Penal Code, Sec. 49.04. That section will tell you that a
          person commits an offense of DWI if the person is “intoxicated” while operating a motor vehicle
          in a public place.
          <br>
          There are three ways a prosecutor in Texas can prove you are intoxicated for purposes of a DWI.
          “Intoxicated” means: (1) not having the normal use of mental faculties by reason of the
          introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two
          or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body; (2) not having the normal use
          of physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a
          dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into
          the body; or (3) having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more. (See Sec. 49.01(2) of Texas
          Penal Code).
          <br>
          The minute you are pulled over by police, the “investigation” begins as to whether you will get a
          DWI. The officer will look for “clues” (such as bloodshot eyes, odor of alcoholic beverage, or
          slurred speech) and ask you if “you have had anything to drink.” If the answer is yes, pretty
          much regardless of the amount you may tell the officer, he or she will make a decision to ask you
          to get out of the car. If asked out of the car, you are going to be arrested. So do not cooperate.
          We have done hundreds of these cases. Call us immediately if you can if you are pulled over. If not,
          call us immediately after your arrest. We can arrange bond, talk you through the process and establish your rights and defenses.
